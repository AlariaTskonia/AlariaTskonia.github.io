Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

They game can be played from a most browsera at: http://alariatskonia.github.io/ndprojects/project3/index.html with the help of a keyboard with arrow keys.  
Unfortunately touch screen capabilities have not yet been implemented.

Move the CatGirl with the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Make it to the water to gain 1 point.  If the bugs hit you, your travel will be reset and the bugs gain a point.

Objective?  Well...it's basic for now...don't get hit by the bugs.
The game will likely be upgraded at some point to allow a better point system, touch screen controls, and a level based difficulty setting.

Many thanks to Craig Hunter and Brad Brezinski for helping me locate missing semi-colons, image issues, understanding the math behind the movement as well as the errors Chrome gave us, and getting the screen to show up!
